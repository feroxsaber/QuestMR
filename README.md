Hololens-style mixed reality for the Oculus Quest 2

## About QuestMR
QuestMR is an application for the Oculus Quest 2 that aims to allow users to "pin" objects to real surfaces, similar to the [original Microsoft Hololens 
trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyzzdMkU7Fw&t=18s). 

## Features

- Separate tools for edit mode (wall edit, window edit, furniture edit, etc...)

### Backburner
- Media player for on-device files
- Remotely connect to a computer, and allow user to pin windows from the computer
- Advanced room setup (desks, couches, etc...)
- Put virtual objects in arbitrary places
- Put custom textures on walls, floor, etc... to create a virtual environment that shares geometry with a real one
- Alternate platform (PCVR, Pico, etc...) support
